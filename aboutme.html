    <h3>Who?</h3>
<p style="color:darkred;">My Profile</p>
<p>
    My name is Buu Pham, and I am a junior here at Juniata College. I study French and
    Hispanic Cultures with a Secondary POE in Anthropology. <br> I hail from Hershey, 
    Pennsylvania, but that is just keeping it simple. This is my life in a nutshell.
</p>
<p style="color: darkred;">But <b>WHO</b> am I really?</p>
<hr>
<h3>What? When? Where? How?</h3>
<p style="color: royalblue;">My Life Story</p>
<p>
    I said I was from Hershey, but I was actually born in Saigon, Vietnam. I moved 
    to the States when I was just two years old.<br>Growing up, I was raised by my 
    Vietnamese mom and an American step-dad. Due to this, my household was very 
    multicultural.<br>I often had a mixture of Vietnamese and American food for meals, 
    or whole days dedicated to one cuisine. Besides that, I grew<br>up speaking both
    Vietnamese and English, so I got a taste of different languages from an early age.
    This is actually why my POE<br>is in French and Spanish. I really enjoyed the 
    idea of the multiculturalism I was exposed to, especially the idea of learning 
    different<br>languages. I can proudly say that I can actually hold a conversation 
    in 4 different languages. However, I am also using Duolingo to<br>learn other 
    languages such as Portuguese, Italian, and even Latin, so I am always learning 
    something new.

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p style="color: seagreen;">My Present Journey</p>
<p>
    I am often asked by everybody, whether it is friends or family about what I hope 
    to achieve with my POE, and honestly,<br>I am not 100% sure myself. I have 
    thought of many different professions, and that can be seen with the constant 
    changes<br>I make with my POE. I officially came in my first year wanting to 
    study French and International Politics. That quickly<br>faded away as I took a variety 
    of classes to get a taste of everything. I've thought of adding anything from 
    PACS to Geology<br>to History. I originally had taken both a French and a Spanish 
    class the fall semester of my first year because I was proficient<br>at both. I 
    decided to stop Spanish after that because I was not sure if it would be helpful 
    to me in the long run regarding a future<br>career. However, after talking with
    many people, and a lot of thinking on my own part, I realized that there would be
    many job<br>opportunities available, especially since I know 4 languages.

<p style="color: seagreen;">What is my <i>LIFE</i> going to look like after I graduate?</p>
<hr>
<h3>So?</h3>
<p style="color:slategrey;">My Future Endeavors</p>
<p>
    I would like to go to grad school after I finish my bachelor's degree. I want to study
    either modern languages or linguistic anthropology<br>for a graduate degree. I hope
    to be able to work in the archives of a museum or be a translator or diplomat for
    the Department of State.<br>The real question right now is where exactly I want to go. 
    My current choices in the Pennsylvania are either Penn State University or<br>Temple 
    University, but I do also want to look into schools in the Northeast such as 
    Massachusetts. However, my ultimate plan is actually<br>to travel outside of the US, 
    so I have looked into schools in Quebec, Canada and even Europe.
</p>
<p style="color:slategrey;">Wherever I end up, I will be fine, as long as I am <span style="color:goldenrod;">HAPPY</span></p>
