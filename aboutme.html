    <h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>
    My name is Buu Pham, and I am a junior here at Juniata College. I study French and
    Spanish with a Secondary POE in Anthropology. <br> I hail from Hershey, Pennsylvania,
     and that is who I am simplified.</p>
<p style="color: darkred;">But <b>WHO</b> am I really?</p>
<hr>
<h3>WHO? WHAT? WHEN? WHERE? HOW?</h3>
<p>
    I said I was from Hershey, but I was actually born in Saigon, Vietnam. I moved to 
    the States when I was just two years old. <br> Growing up, I was raised by my 
    Vietnamese mom and an American step-dad. Due to this, my household was very 
    multicultural. <br> I often had a mixture of Vietnamese and American food for meals, 
    or whole days dedicated to one cuisine. Besides that, I grew <br> up speaking both
    Vietnamese and English, so I got a taste of different languages from an early age.
    This is actually why my POE <br> is in French and Spanish. I really enjoyed the 
    idea of the multiculturalism I was exposed to, especially the idea of learning 
    different <br> languages. I can proudly say that I can actually hold a conversation 
    in 4 different languages. However, I am also using Duolingo to <br> learn other 
    languages such as Portuguese, Italian, and even Latin, so I am always learning 
    something new.

<h3>My Dream Profession</h3>
<p>
    I am often asked by everybody, whether it is friends or family about what I hope 
    to achieve with my POE, and honestly, I am not 100% sure myself.
