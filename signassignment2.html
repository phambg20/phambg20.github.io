    Who We Are
</p>
<p class="message" style="font-size: large;">
    <br>
        With over 20,000 students and even more alumni, the Chocolatetown family 
    is abundant and found all over the world. <br> Our way of thinking stems from 
    the same thoughts of Milton Hershey when he chose Derry Township as the setting 
    for his factory, freshness. <br> While he was pursuing fresh milk for his 
    chocolate, we are pursuing fresh ideas for and from our students. 
        Family is a core value here at CU, <br> so cooperation and working together
    is a key part of our success. We are constantly working with his company and 
    others to provide factory <br> experience and exciting opportunities and 
    internships not just to our business students but beyond. 
        On campus, we have over 200 acres of land <br> with state-of-the-art 
    facilities and expert faculty working inside of them. Our diverse student body 
    works to tackle challenging coursework <br> and problems facing the modern world 
    with faculty advisors standing beside them the entire time. Besides from academic 
    support, <br> our students are also provided with a lively campus life with our
    sports as well as our countless number of clubs harboring <br> many different 
    interests. Milton Hershey strived to provide academic and financial support for all of 
    the students of his school. <br> We are achieving the same goal and more to carry 
    on his message, and to make sure that our students create their own legacy just 
    as he did. <br>
